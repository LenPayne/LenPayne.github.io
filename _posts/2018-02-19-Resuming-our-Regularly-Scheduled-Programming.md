Welcome back. It's been too long. Far too long. Today is Family Day in Ontario,
and I am spending time with my family. Which means I get a rare chance to do
things not related to work.

I've got some refreshing to do on the site. A few updates to make. But I'm going
to try and keep it short and optimize my use of time.

Big News:

* I am currently on a leave of absence from my full-time job at Lambton College.
* During my leave, I am working as the Chief Technology Officer of [Link2Feed](http://www.link2feed.com).
* The [Sarnia Tech Community](https://www.sarniatech.ca) has been growing!
* And we launched the [Sarnia-Lambton Linux Users Group](https://www.sllug.ca).

Lots of stuff going on both offline and online in Sarnia. It's a very exciting
time!
