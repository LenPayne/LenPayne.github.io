Welcome back to good intentions. This week I'd like to focus on tech news sources
so that I can provide a comprehensive list for my new students that are starting
at [Lambton College](http://www.lambtoncollege.ca) in the [CPRO](http://www.lambtoncollege.ca/CPRO),
[CSAC](http://www.lambtoncollege.ca/CSAC), [IPRC](http://www.lambtoncollege.ca/IPRC),
and [ITP](http://www.lambtoncollege.ca/ITPP) programs.

The two most important sources I use are [reddit](https://www.reddit.com) and
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). These are news aggregators and
communities unto themselves.

But there's so much more, so I'll continue and break it down into a categorized list.
