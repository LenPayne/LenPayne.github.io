This week I'd like to focus on the state of the industry in Canadian Tech. A
small group of us from [the Cube](http://mylambton.ca/theCube) went to the
[Canadian Innovation Exchange](http://www.canadianinnovationexchange.com) this
past week and it got me to thinking that I'd like to do a little who's who and
what's what.

#### Success Breeds Jobs

The biggest way to find success is to see [who's hiring](http://www.techvibes.com/job/global).
Check out [the Hacker News Who's Hiring Map by Gaganpreet](http://gaganpreet.github.io/hn-hiring-mapped/src/web/)
to see some other hot tech companies that are smart enough to post on HN.

#### Keeping Up with the Joneses

Sometimes it's really hard to keep track of Canadian tech news: it gets washed
away in the flood of American/World tech news. There's a few standby sources that
I rely on for the meat of my information:

1. [TechVibes](http://www.techvibes.com/global) - Tech news based in Canada
2. [StartupNorth](http://startupnorth.ca/) - Started as a Blog, now an FB Group
3. Dumb Luck - Every once in awhile a Canadian company will appear on reddit or HN
