title: Brainstorming a Plan

I'm going to use this as a bit of a stream-of-consciousness post that will wrap
around and collect some of my more useful meanderings into semi-coherent plans.

In short: I'm trying to practice logging/journalling. It's been a while.

The biggest directions I want to go in are: reading, writing, and video production.

It's not quite the 3 Rs, but it's where my head is going these days and I want
to follow my brain. Feel free to follow along.

### Reading

I've found great utility out of the kind of curated news feeds that come across
my desk. Things like the brief sampling from the [O'Reilly Four Short Links by Nat Torkington](http://post.oreilly.com/form/oreilly/viewhtml/9z1zbr0ee1adiqjpevhkvdgqeh554d7eqcu61f9pm1o),
and the constant stream of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and
[TechVibes](http://www.techvibes.com/global).

I think it would benefit me and my students/readers/audience to continue the
tradition and curate some content that I've been reading. I regularly use the
[Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) Chrome extension to share articles easily via
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/LenAtLambton). But I think there would be some use
to myself and others to build a weekly curated list of "cool stuff I saw."

Just another drop in the bucket in most cases, but something of a TL;DR exercise
would help me engage more with the material and be a more conscious consumer.

### Writing

I write a lot of throwaway code in my day job (ie- samples). I even write some
useful code now and then (ps- we were approved for another big research fund in
August.) But it's been a long time since I've written anything other than
Facebook comments/posts, or emails.

I mean, I wrote a novel in 2008. A novel. [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/) was
a cool thing, and I enjoyed it. (No, that novel will never see the light of day.)

So why haven't I been writing lately? What is getting in the way?

Partly: I'm not sure what to write about. Literally, this post is "I don't know
what I want to say." In addition to that, I'm at a loss for time. My free hours
have been gobbled up either completing work for work, or completing work for fun
(and maybe profit.)

But I miss the creative side: the endeavour of putting things to life that had
not existed before. I get to do that with coding, to an extent, but there are
definitely untapped reaches that I'd like to explore.

So I think that I am going to start a bit of an essay series. I want to warm up.

Ultimately, I want to be able to get my work published to a wider audience. Either
in traditional print, or as a contributor on a highly trafficked blog. I want to
get the practice and the engagement that only really comes from putting yourself
out there.

And then I want to start pumping out textbooks and/or learning materials.

Right now, textbooks target technologies rather than a holistic approach. So for
example, you can pick up a jQuery/JavaScript textbook and it covers exactly what
you would expect. Or a Hadoop, or Scala, or whatever. I don't want to build that
kind of learning tool. I want to build a tool that guides learners on a more
whole-subject approach: for example, instead of covering jQuery from nose to toes,
cover a series of examples (and always give alternatives.)

I will be building articles/posts/etc with this format in mind. As time allows.

### Video Production

Which brings me to video. YouTube is a ridiculously open platform for monetizing
content. Make good videos: provide a service. Then, you will see revenue. It's
not a torrent, but it can turn into one. So I want to pair every article with a
series of videos demonstrating the skills.

So for example, let's say I was doing an article on "Building a MEAN App", I would
write the article at a high level (ie- 3-5min read) that covered the "Why" of
building the app, and the decision-making process. Then build a series of 3-5min
videos that cover the "How" of building the app. (Probably also build a video of
me reading the 3-5min article, for those that prefer to watch.)

And you know, MEAN is a good target, but it's also a saturated market. I'm
heavily considering switching my personal development projects to GoLang, and
building materials that use Go and Angular in unison. Should be an interesting
path to go down. I may even dig into Angular 2.

### Summarizing Our Findings

As I mentioned, this was a bit of stream-of-consciousness writing. I genuinely
find that writing allows me to slow my mind down and actualize my thoughts. So
this is something I hope to do more often. But that means now that I've hit a
good stopping point, I need to look back and see what I wrote, to summarize things.

I had a realization in the car today. I am not an overly religious man, but I
understand the utility of prayer. It helps you to vocalize and actualize your
hopes and fears. So let's call this a little bit of vocalization on my hopes and
fears.

I want to:

1. Begin a weekly "Highlight Reel" style summary of the past week. A tl;dr of
this week in the web.
2. Start writing more. Both this style of journal/log, and more formal articles.
3. Begin exploring GoLang and Angular2, for personal projects and education.
4. Develop a series of articles and videos that demonstrate GoLang and Angular2
to the masses.

Wish me luck.
